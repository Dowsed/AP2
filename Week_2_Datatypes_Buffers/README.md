# Things to do before week 3
1) Write a basic implementation of vector using the std::vector class as a guide (make sure to set up a repo for this and commit regularly)
2) Look at various coding standards i.e. https://juce.com/discover/stories/coding-standards
3) Learn to use your IDEs debugger:
    Visual Studio - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ebzPwixrJA
    Xcode - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzSw-LkoQYY
4) Research the following topics - assertions, exceptions, unit testing, integration testing, TDD (test driven development)
5) How might you write tests to check your vector implementation? Do you think working in a TDD manner would have been helpful?
