This weeks homework will give you a solid foundation for your first assignment for AP2, in which you will need to create your own novel distortion plug-in (see blackboard for more details). Please create a waveshaper-based distortion plug-in:

- The waveshaping must be done using a custom distortion class created from scratch.

- The class must be able to handle sample-by-sample based and block-based programming and be able to switch between numerous waveshaping functions. 

- You must use Juce Audio Parameters and the Generic Audio Editor (e.g. an automatically generated GUI). Use the Juce API and tutorials for more information on these topics.

Feel free to extend the functionality of the plug-in with other controllable parameters such as alpha values, mix blends etc.

However, you do not need to add a custom UI, automation options or state saving and loading facilities to this plug-in!
